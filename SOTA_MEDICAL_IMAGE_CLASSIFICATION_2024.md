##**Architecture Evolution: What's Winning in 2024**

###**1. Vision Transformers (ViTs) - The New Standard**

**Why ViTs Excel in Medical Imaging:**
-**Attention mechanisms** capture long-range dependencies in medical images
-**Patch-based processing** handles varying image resolutions well
-**Transfer learning** from large-scale pretraining performs excellently
-**Interpretability** through attention maps valuable for medical applications

```python
# Modern ViT Implementation for Medical Images
from transformers import ViTForImageClassification, ViTImageProcessor

model = ViTForImageClassification.from_pretrained(
'google/vit-base-patch16-224-in21k',
num_labels=num_medication_classes,
ignore_mismatched_sizes=True
)
```

**Key Variants for Medical Applications:**
-**DeiT (Data-efficient ViT)**: Better for smaller medical datasets
-**Swin Transformer**: Hierarchical processing good for varying pill sizes
-**BiT (Big Transfer)**: Excellent transfer learning for medical domains

###**2. EfficientNet Family - Still Highly Competitive**

**Why EfficientNets Remain Relevant:**
-**Computational efficiency** critical for edge deployment
-**Proven track record** in medical imaging competitions
-**Good balance** of accuracy vs. inference speed
-**Well-understood** optimization and deployment patterns

```python
# EfficientNetV2 for Production Medical AI
import efficientnet.tfkeras as efn

model = efn.EfficientNetV2B1(
weights='imagenet',
include_top=False,
input_shape=(224, 224, 3)
)
```

###**3. Hybrid Architectures - The Emerging Winner**

**CoAtNet and ConvNeXt**: Combining CNN and Transformer benefits
-**Local feature extraction** (CNN) +**Global attention** (Transformer)
-**Better inductive biases** for medical image structure
-**Improved data efficiency** compared to pure ViTs
