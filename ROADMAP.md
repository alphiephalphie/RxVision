# RxVision25

## Increasing Medication Safety Through Advanced Image Recognition and AI

### Overview
Medication errors remain one of the most persistent challenges in global healthcare systems, contributing to preventable adverse drug events (ADEs) and significant financial and human costs. Despite advancements in healthcare technology, errors in medication identification, dispensing, and administration continue to occur across patient, pharmacy, and emergency care settings.

**RxVision25** leverages state-of-the-art deep learning and computer vision technologies to address these challenges through accurate, scalable, and privacy-preserving medication identification tools. This project represents a significant evolution from the original RxVision, incorporating modern AI architectures, real-world validation pipelines, and deployment strategies designed for real-world healthcare integration.

### Mission Statement
To reduce medication errors and improve patient safety through real-time, accurate, and scalable AI-powered medication identification, empowering patients, healthcare professionals, and emergency responders with actionable insights.

### Objectives
1. **Medication Identification for Patients:** Develop a smartphone-based tool enabling patients to confidently identify medications, validate prescriptions, and check recall statuses.
2. **Pharmacy Workflow Optimization:** Integrate AI-powered medication validation tools into pharmacy workflows to minimize dispensing errors and optimize technician efficiency.
3. **Emergency Medication Recognition:** Provide emergency responders and healthcare professionals with an offline-compatible AI tool for rapid medication identification in critical situations.
4. **Counterfeit Detection:** Implement advanced image recognition to identify inconsistencies in medication appearance, supporting counterfeit detection efforts.

## Problem Statement
### Medication Errors: A Persistent Crisis
- Medication errors are the **third leading cause of preventable death** in the United States.
- The **financial burden** of ADEs exceeds **$37.6 billion annually**, with preventable errors contributing significantly to these costs.
- **Polypharmacy risks** continue to grow, with over **30% of Americans taking five or more daily medications.**

### Core Challenges Addressed by RxVision25
1. **Patient-Level Errors:** Misidentification of medications due to similar appearance, improper labeling, or recall confusion.
2. **Pharmacy-Level Errors:** Dispensing mistakes caused by fatigue, mislabeling, and manual inspection failures.
3. **Emergency-Level Errors:** Limited time and resources for medication verification in critical care scenarios.
4. **Counterfeit Drug Risks:** Proliferation of fake medications in both regulated and unregulated markets.
