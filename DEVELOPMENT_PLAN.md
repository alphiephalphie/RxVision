# RxVision25 Development Plan

## Project Overview
RxVision25 is the modernized evolution of the original RxVision medication identification system, designed to achieve >95% real-world accuracy through advanced deep learning architectures and deployment strategies.

## Current Status
-**Legacy Performance**: VGG16 model with 93% validation accuracy, ~50% real-world accuracy
-**Target Performance**: >95% real-world accuracy with <1 second inference time
-**Infrastructure**: Basic training pipeline exists, needs modernization

## Phase 1: Core Model Modernization (Weeks 1-2)

### 1.1 Model Architecture Upgrade
-**Task**: Replace VGG16 with EfficientNetV2-B0 transfer learning
-**Rationale**: EfficientNetV2-B0 (5.9M params) chosen over B1 for faster iteration and debugging during initial development
-**Implementation**: `src/models/architectures.py`
-**Success Criteria**: Initial model training pipeline functional with >80% validation accuracy

### 1.2 Advanced Data Augmentation
-**Task**: Implement Albumentations pipeline with medical image specific augmentations
-**Rationale**: Bridge gap between lab and real-world conditions
-**Implementation**: `src/data/augmentation.py`
-**Success Criteria**: Augmentation pipeline increases real-world performance

### 1.3 Hybrid API Infrastructure (gRPC + REST)
-**Task**: Implement gRPC for efficient image transfer + REST for health checks
-**Rationale**: gRPC chosen for large image payloads and potential streaming, REST for simplicity
-**Implementation**: `src/inference/api.py` (REST) + `src/inference/grpc_service.py` (gRPC)
-**Success Criteria**: Both APIs serve predictions with <2s latency

## Phase 2: Infrastructure & Quality (Weeks 3-4)

### 2.1 Testing Framework
-**Task**: Comprehensive test suite with realistic scenarios
-**Implementation**: Expand `tests/` directory
-**Success Criteria**: >80% code coverage, integration tests pass

### 2.2 Model Optimization
-**Task**: ONNX export for deployment optimization
-**Implementation**: `src/inference/optimization.py`
-**Success Criteria**: Model inference time <500ms

### 2.3 Experiment Tracking
-**Task**: MLflow integration for model versioning and metrics
-**Implementation**: MLflow configuration and logging
-**Success Criteria**: All experiments tracked and reproducible

## Phase 3: Production Readiness (Weeks 5-6)

### 3.1 Containerization
-**Task**: Docker setup for consistent deployment
-**Implementation**: Dockerfile, docker-compose.yml
-**Success Criteria**: Application runs consistently across environments

### 3.2 CI/CD Pipeline
-**Task**: Automated testing and deployment
-**Implementation**: GitHub Actions or similar
-**Success Criteria**: Automated testing on PR, deployment pipeline

## Technical Architecture

### Data Pipeline
```
NIH RxImage Data → Preprocessing → Augmentation → Training/Validation Split
```

### Model Pipeline
```
EfficientNetV2 Backbone → Transfer Learning → Fine-tuning → ONNX Export
```

### Inference Pipeline
```
Image Upload → Preprocessing → Model Inference → Post-processing → JSON Response
```

## Key Performance Indicators

### Model Performance
-**Real-world accuracy**: >95% (currently ~50%)
-**Inference latency**: <1 second (target <500ms optimized)
-**Model size**: <100MB for edge deployment
-**Healthcare-grade precision/recall**: Focus on minimizing false negatives

### System Performance 
-**API response time**: <2 seconds end-to-end (gRPC <1s, REST <2s)
-**Concurrent users**: Support 10+ simultaneous requests
-**Uptime**: 99%+ availability
-**Cost optimization**: <$25/month infrastructure budget

### Development Metrics
-**Code coverage**: >80%
-**Documentation coverage**: 100% of public APIs
-**Test success rate**: >95%

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1.**Model Performance**: Implement comprehensive validation with real-world test set
2.**Deployment Complexity**: Use containerization and infrastructure as code
3.**Data Quality**: Implement robust preprocessing and validation

### Project Risks
1.**Scope Creep**: Maintain focus on core accuracy improvement
2.**Timeline**: Prioritize high-impact features first
3.**Resource Constraints**: Personal project, limit complexity accordingly

## Success Criteria
