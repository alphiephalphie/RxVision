# ML Engineering Skills Evolution: 2019 → 2024

## Executive Summary
The ML engineering landscape has undergone massive transformation since 2019. What was once primarily about model accuracy is now about building reliable, scalable, observable production systems. The focus has shifted from "getting models to work" to "getting models to work reliably at scale in production."
